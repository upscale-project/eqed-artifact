# eqed-artifact examples

This directory contains examples for E-QED using the OpenSPARC T2 SoC.

Hierarchy:

1) test - simulation setup and QED tests for the OpenSPARC T2 SoC.


2) source - RTL for the OpenSPARC T2 and the example from the CAV'17
            paper to enable formal analysis of the designs with E-QED.


3) run - run scripts used to apply E-QED analysis.
