# eqed-artifact examples

This directory contains examples for E-QED using the OpenSPARC T2 SoC.

Hierarchy:

1) test - simulation setup and QED tests for the OpenSPARC T2 SoC.


2) formal - modified RTL for the OpenSPARC T2 to enable formal analysis of the
            design with E-QED.


3) scripts - run scripts used to apply E-QED analysis using Mentor Graphics' 
             Questa formal tool.
